## CP65S Sager NP8650 / Clover P650SA

current issues:

1. brightness value not persist among restarts
2. audio card not working ( won't boot once AppleALC enabled, if hotpatch enabled gives resources not ready, if without hotpatch, repeating message:  codec property missing, skipping )
3. usb states messed up after sleep
