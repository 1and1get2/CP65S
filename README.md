## CP65S Sager NP8650 / Clover P650SA

current issues:

1. brightness value not persist among restarts
2. audio card not working ( won't boot once AppleALC enabled, if hotpatch enabled gives resources not ready, if without hotpatch, repeating message:  codec property missing, skipping )
3. usb states messed up after sleep
4. ~~instant wake: Wake reason: GLAN. fixed USB cut off after wake.~~
sleep is now working, however we won't be able to wake up on mouse/keyboard press, it's no big deal but I'll try to fix it when i have the time.
